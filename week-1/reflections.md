# 1.1 Think About Time
The time management and productivity ideas I learned most about during these readings are meditation, the pomodoro technique, as well as more detail on the habits and growth mindset. The links were great resources to read more on these topics, expand my knowledge, and learn how to apply what I do in order to be more productive  and successful - both for everyday tasks, as well as in the long run. I found the article on meditation to be very interesting. I've meditated in the past but mostly to relax and clear my mind in the moment. It was interesting to read that this can also be used to relieve stress, and meditation can help to lessen anxiety, as we all have moments where we need to suppress the "white bears", and according to this reading, this seems to be something that could help, as well with making you a calmer, more balanced individual overall. 
It was great to see the Pomodoro technique on this list, as it is something I'd been curious about in the past. I like the idea of working for a set amount of time, then taking a small break. Using this in the past has actually helped me focus without taking too many breaks to read the news or log onto my favorite social media site, as I know that once I get through the 25 minutes, I'll have a break long enough to clear my mind, where I'm ready to then begin again to get the tasks completed. The pomodoro technique uses "Time Boxing", where a person or team agrees upon a set period of time to complete a goal. I think this can be very useful during Phase 0 both for working on individual projects, as well as when pair programming, as time boxing can be used to switch between the typer and the speaker, or if you're stuck on a particular area, you can use time boxing to give yourself a certain amount of time to solve a problem. 

Currently, I use Google Calendar as well as the pomodoro technique to manage my time and set aside time to work on specific projects. My current strategy works for the workload and tasks I have, which aren't many. Before beginning DBC, I only had a full-time job and a few extracurricular activities. Google Calendar is great for managing meetings, but as my schedule will now be busier and probably more stressful, I know I can benefit from using some of these strategies combined with my own. In order to better manage my time during Phase 0, I will continue to use Google Calendar for any meetings or sessions I may need to attend, along with the pomodoro technique, but I will use the pomodoro technique and time boxing in general for more of my tasks, like for pair programming and working on solo projects. In addition, as I'll now be balancing my full-time job with an additional 15-25 hours per week for DBC, I'll use meditation to help keep me focused and balanced.

## 1.2 The Command Line

1. What is a shell? What is "bash?" -  A shell is a command line in the operating system that allows you to input commands in order to find files and directories, reorganize files, as well as remove folders and add empty files, among other tasks. 

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? - The most challenging part of this material for me occurred about midway through the command line material when the learning where we had to incorporate some of the previous commands. As it was my first time going through these commands, it took a bit of practice to go through each for this to stick, but after repeating (and re-reading some of) the sections, this became less of a challenge. One other important aspect that took a bit of practice was typing out all the commands. It was pretty important to remember where to include the spaces in order for the command to go through, so paying attention to each small detail was very important! 

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? - I was able to successfully complete all the commands. Some of them took a couple of times to run through, if I was trying to cd into a file that I had removed from a previous lesson, or moved into another folder, but after practicing the commands a few time, I was able to complete them. 

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? - I'd say the most important commands are cd, ls, pwd, find, and man(or help, for Mac). I found cd to be important as it helped me sort out where each of my temp files were located, and pwd also helped me see the written out directory. Ls is also important, as it allows you to view all the files that are in a particular directory, so if you're looking for a particular file and if there aren't many files, you can just list them using this command to see if you can find what you're looking for. Find is also important, as you can find many different files, depending on what search criteria you'd like to use, and you can search at many different levels (all of computer, particular folder, for a user), which comes in handy. Lastly man (or help) was an important one, as it allows you to quickly look up commands if you're not sure what one does, or just need  a quick reminder.  

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd - print working directory

-ls - list the directory

-mv - move directory or file

-cd - change directory

-../ - move up one level in the directory

-touch - create an empty file

-mkdir - make a new directory

-less - page through file

-rmdir - remove a directory

-rm - delete/remove a file

-help - look up a command in the manual(same as "man" in Mac OS)
